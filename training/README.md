## Project: Skin cancer image classification


Each year there are more new cases of skin cancer than the combined incidence of cancers of the breast, prostate, lung and colon.Over the past three decades, more people have had skin cancer than all other cancers combined.

The aim of this project is to classify the skin cancer images into its types. 

The model classifies the images into the three types of skin cancer -

1. Basal 
2. Melanoma  
3. Squamous 

 This project uses transfer learning methods using Inception v3 architecture for image classification.

## Required Libraries

* Tensorflow
* Keras
